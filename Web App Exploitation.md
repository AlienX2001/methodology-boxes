## If we have a laravel app
### If the version is through 5.5.40 and 5.6.x through 5.6.29
If we have its base64 encoded APP_KEY then we can use this https://github.com/AlienX2001/better-poc-for-CVE-2018-15133 to get an rce on the machine

## In case of an adminer instance

## for drupal CMS
### If we engage with drupal CMS including 8.5 prior to 8.5.1, 7.x prior to 7.58 and all version of Drupal 6.
Then we can use drupalgeddon2.0 exploit

## If via burp or from the page source analysis we see that the webapp is working with xml
Then we can check for xxe, more on that here https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe and https://www.synack.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-xxe-injection/

## If we are working with JWT
If we somehow get a hold of the algorithm key, if its using HS256 algorithm then we can craft our own jwt signed with the leaked key to get access

## If we manage to get hold of the aws dynamoDB js shell
We can use the templates and extract information about the DB and use those in the aws cli to get code exec

## In support portals if we get email addresses to contact to
Then we might be able to leverage that to get private emails as was with the case with HTB's delivery box, can refer writeups of the same to know more
